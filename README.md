## Project Description
"New York State: A land of promise or compromise? Let’s uncover the story..." Through this tableau project, we explore whether New York State lives up to its reputation as a land of opportunity or if compromises must be made. From energy and sustainability to public
safety and economic opportunities, each dashboard tells a part of this story. The Solar Energy Incentives and Energy Price Dashboards shed light on the state’s commitment to renewable
energy and the affordability of energy costs. The Hospital Dashboard examines healthcare accessibility and affordability, while the Crime and Hate Crime Dashboards highlight safety
concerns and regional crime patterns. Finally, the Employment Insights Dashboard reveals trends in job growth, regional opportunities, and educational requirements. Together, these
dashboards provide a data-driven narrative to assess whether New York offers a life of promise or compromise.
